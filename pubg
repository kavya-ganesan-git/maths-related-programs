Problem Description
There are N players, each with strength A[i]. when player i attack player j,
player j strength reduces to max(0, A[j]-A[i]). When a player's strength reaches zero, it
loses the game, and the game continues in the same manner among other players until
only 1 survivor remains.
Can you tell the minimum health last surviving person can have?
Problem Constraints
• 1 <= N <= 100000
• 1 <= A[i] <= 1000000
Input Format
First and only argument of input contains a single integer array A.
Output Format
Return a single integer denoting minimum health of last person.
Example Input
Input 1:
A = [6, 4]
Input 2:
A = [2, 3, 4]
12
Example Output
Output 1:
2
Output 2:
1
Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
Given strength array A = [6, 4]
Second player attack first player, A = [2, 4]
First player attack second player twice. [2, 0]
Explanation 2:
Given strength array A = [2, 3, 4]
First player attack third player twice. [2, 3, 0]
First player attack second player. [2, 1, 0]
Second player attack first player twice. [0, 1, 0]
